        Non-coding Related Projects
        <br>
        Capstone Project – Biological Research Laboratory February 2018 – April 2018
        <ul>
            <li>Determined the effect on water quality if copper were present for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>Prepared several different samples separated into two groups: the experimental group and the control group, which allowed a comparison to be made between the different conditions.</li>
            <li>Accurately measured several variables, such as the dissolved oxygen level and nitrates level.</li>
            <li>Prepared a comprehensive report detailing the results and presented it to fellow peers.</li>
        </ul>
        DNA Barcoding Project February 2018 – April 2018
        <ul>
            <li>Collected an animal sample and a plant sample from a lake for DNA barcoding.</li>
            <li>Prepared both samples for DNA replication and made homogeneous solutions.</li>
            <li>Accurately identified the species of each sample after the DNA was isolated and sequenced.</li>
        </ul>
        Senior Design Project – Chem & Biochem Design & Econ I & II September 2016 – April 2017
        <ul>
            <li>Designed and simulated a profitable chemical plant in Aspen Plus that efficiently turned biomass into a fuel.</li>
            <li>Combined several different simulations into one seamless simulation and optimized it in order to maximize the fuel output.</li>
            <li>Analyzed the results in order to determine the exact cost and profit of the plant.</li>
            <li>Wrote a comprehensive report detailing the specifics about the plant and then presented the findings to fellow peers in a concise and informative manner.</li>
        </ul>
